# uwebdavclient - (Micro) WebDAV client

## About

Minimal WebDAV client in pure Python. Only `GET`, `MKCOL`, and `PUT`
are supported. Consider
(webdavclient3)[https://pypi.org/project/webdavclient3] for more
extensive support.  The disk (container image) space gain by using
this microscopic library is in the order of 15 MiB.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install uwebdavclient --user
